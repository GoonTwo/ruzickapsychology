              When you submit the consultation form, Ruzicka Psychology receives
              the information you choose to provide, such as your name, contact
              details, location, therapy interest, scheduling preferences, and
              message.
            </Text>
            <Text>
              The form is delivered through Web3Forms. Please use it for
              scheduling questions or a brief general note—not emergencies,
              detailed medical information, or highly sensitive clinical
              history. Submitting the form does not establish a
              psychologist-client relationship.
